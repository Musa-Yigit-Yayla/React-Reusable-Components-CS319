# React-Reusable-Components
 Reusable React.js components I have built...
 
 You can follow the documentation provided in .js files to reuse these components in your applications' frontend.
 
 Currently this repository contains:
 1-) A Chatbox component which supports real time messaging when linked to backend with line break algorithms.
 2-) A Profile Image Selector component which behaves like a Whatsapp style profile image selection bounded with an outer circle and a filter.
 3-) A Messages Pane component which represents the messages (chats) a user has been involved in a vertical scrollpane layout style.
